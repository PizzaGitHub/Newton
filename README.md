STRUCTURE: 

- GALOIS.h: useful mathematical functions and routines, contains the Tensor class
- GALILEO.h: contains the physical laws of motion (classical, relativistic, the more the better) and the algorythms for numerical integration (RK4, dum, strange, ...) to generate them, givent the acceleration.
